# claude-code-multimodel-workflow — SessionStart hook: inject dispatch rules as additional context.
#
# Claude Code's plugin loader does not auto-inject markdown from a `rules/`
# directory the way it does for `skills/` or `agents/`. To make these rules
# active default behavior, we read every `*.md` under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/`
# at session start and emit the concatenated content on stdout, which CC
# captures as additional system context.
#
# Adopters can disable by removing the SessionStart entry in the plugin's
# settings, or by deleting individual rule files.
